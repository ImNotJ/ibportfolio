## 3-Statement Model:
In this case study, I built a complete 3-statement model for Otis, a global leader in elevator and escalator manufacturing and services. The model integrates the company's Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement to project its financial performance over a five-year period. This analysis includes historical data input, key projections for revenue, expenses, and working capital, and the linkage of all three financial statements. The model helps assess Otis' financial health, ability to generate cash flow, and strategies for debt repayment and stock repurchases.
