## 3-Statement Model:
In this case study, I built a complete 3-statement model for Otis, a global leader in elevator and escalator manufacturing and services. The model integrates the company's Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement to project its financial performance over a five-year period. This analysis includes historical data input, key projections for revenue, expenses, and working capital, and the linkage of all three financial statements. The model helps assess Otis' financial health, ability to generate cash flow, and strategies for debt repayment and stock repurchases.

## DCF:
I developed a DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model for NVIDIA to analyze its intrinsic value and implied share price, driven by a desire to challenge myself and gain a deeper understanding of financial valuation techniques. The model incorporates NVIDIA’s historical financial data and projects future cash flows based on revenue growth, margins, and capital expenditures. Additionally, it applies a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to discount these cash flows, reflecting the company’s capital structure. By forecasting free cash flow and adjusting for debt and equity, the model provides a detailed valuation framework to estimate the fair value of NVIDIA’s stock.
